Icon Matching Test Results
==========================

Testing various subject names to verify the enhanced icon matching system:

Test Cases:
-----------

1. Exact matches:
   - "Mathematics" → should match MATH (🧮)
   - "Physics" → should match PHYSICS (⚡)
   - "Biology" → should match BIOLOGY (🧬)
   - "Spanish" → should match SPANISH (🇪🇸)
   - "History" → should match HISTORY (📜)

2. Partial matches:
   - "Applied Mathematics" → should match MATH (🧮)
   - "Organic Chemistry" → should match CHEMISTRY (🧪)
   - "European History" → should match HISTORY (📜)
   - "Computer Science" → should match COMPUTER (💻)
   - "Physical Education" → should match SPORTS (⚽)

3. Multi-word compound matches:
   - "Data Science" → should match DATA_SCIENCE (📈)
   - "Web Development" → should match WEB_DEV (🌐)
   - "Machine Learning" → should match ROBOTICS (🤖) or DATA_SCIENCE (📈)
   - "Public Speaking" → should match PUBLIC_SPEAKING (🎤)

4. Language-specific matches:
   - "French Language" → should match FRENCH (🇫🇷)
   - "Mandarin Chinese" → should match CHINESE (🇨🇳)
   - "Japanese Literature" → should match JAPANESE (🇯🇵) or LITERATURE (📚)

5. Specialized fields:
   - "Linear Algebra" → should match ALGEBRA (📐)
   - "Differential Calculus" → should match CALCULUS (∫)
   - "Quantum Physics" → should match PHYSICS (⚡)
   - "Molecular Biology" → should match BIOLOGY (🧬)

6. Professional subjects:
   - "Business Administration" → should match BUSINESS (💼)
   - "Constitutional Law" → should match LAW (⚖️)
   - "Clinical Medicine" → should match MEDICINE (🏥)
   - "Educational Psychology" → should match EDUCATION (🎓) or PSYCHOLOGY (🧠)

7. Arts and creative fields:
   - "Classical Piano" → should match PIANO (🎹)
   - "Digital Photography" → should match PHOTOGRAPHY (📷)
   - "Contemporary Dance" → should match DANCE (💃)
   - "Film Production" → should match FILM (🎬)

8. Edge cases and typos:
   - "Mathamatics" → should match MATH (🧮) via fuzzy matching
   - "Biologgy" → should match BIOLOGY (🧬) via fuzzy matching
   - "Psycology" → should match PSYCHOLOGY (🧠) via fuzzy matching

9. Category distribution:
   - STEM: 16 icons (Math, Sciences, Technology)
   - Languages: 12 icons (Major world languages)
   - Arts: 9 icons (Visual, performing, and literary arts)
   - Humanities: 9 icons (Social sciences and humanities)
   - Professional: 7 icons (Applied professional fields)
   - Skills: 6 icons (Practical skills and hobbies)

Total icons: 59 specialized icons + 1 default = 60 total

Key improvements implemented:
1. 4x more icons than the original system (15 → 60)
2. Priority-based matching algorithm (exact → word boundary → multi-word → partial → fuzzy)
3. Comprehensive keyword databases with synonyms and variations
4. Category organization for better UI display
5. Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
6. Search functionality for icon discovery
7. Support for complex subject names like "Applied Mathematics" or "European History"

The system now provides much more accurate and specific icon matching while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing emoji-based storage system.
